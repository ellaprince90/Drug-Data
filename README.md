For this project, I took data from accidental drug related deaths and used a logistic regression, random forest classifier, and Cat Booster Classifier to analyze the data. I wanted to find out what other factors could be used to predict a Fentanyl Overdose. The Cat Booster Classifier returned the most consistent results with a 91 % accuracy in botht the training data and test data. Based on this model, the most important indicator was whether there was another Opiod involved. The second most important was the date. When I plotted the date versus the Fentanyl overdoses on a bar chart, it became evident that the Fentanyl overdoses increased every year. I also explored the data for overdoses by month and day of the week. No significant patterns were discernible for either of these parameters.
